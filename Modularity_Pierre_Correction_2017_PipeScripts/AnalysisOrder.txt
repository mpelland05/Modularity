%Creation/official update: 2017/04/14
%This is the new analysis order following Pierre's suggestion that permuttations should be on the subject rather than on the average 

1) Testing differences between groups

	1.1) --LaunchCompareTopographies-- 

		 Compares for each voxel/atom how much the map linked to this parcel ressembles the map of other participants. 
	
	 	  Note: the first version of the script used the whole partitions to compare groups. However, some partitions at low levels
			span more than just the occipital lobe which led to problems when investigating differences only at the the level of
			this lobe (for exemple, looking only at the Occ. Lobe, 2 participants might have really similar networks. However, in one 
			participant, this network would span all of the frontal lobe too, leading to low score of similarity between them).
			Thus, the second version of the script avoids this issue by masking analysis with the mask of voxel of interest. 
			
			Maxime's script particularities (for creator only):
				Moreover, if data comes from graph theory results (no maps yet made), used LaunchMappPartitions to obtain the data for 
				this step.

	1.2 ) -- AverageDiCeGeneral --
		This script will average dice scores first over a list of scales (inputs can be placed so that scale averaging does not take place), and 
		then accross Participants. The latter step is necessary for statistical comparisions later on. 
		
		Basically gives you the average intra vs inter group similarity over a list of scales and subscales for each participant. 

	1.3) Use CompareDiCe/CompareDiCePaired
		The paired version should be used on dependent data (repeated measures). 
		 

	1.4)Use mapP/Qvalues to obtain a map of the results
		




2) Visualizing differences between consensus maps for each group

	2.1) Use InStab2GroupStab
		This will take individual stability maps from a single group and compute its group stability map.
		
		Note: This uses a personally modified script from what Pierre uses, niak_brick_stability_group_maxime.

	2.2) Use a script to launch the mapping
		Note: no particular script was written for this, so take this: 'LaunchMapping_Rest_onlyCBSCMixed' as a example on how to write
		the script. 

3) Visualize differences in grouping
     Check out script, and take MakeAverageMaps.
