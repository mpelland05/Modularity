1) Testing differences between groups

	1.1) use  LaunchCompareTopographies_old
		 or 
		LaunchCompareTopographies to get the overlap values at each voxels.

		 Compares for each voxel/atom how much the map linked to this parcel ressembles the map of other participants. 
	
	 	  Note: the first version of the script used the whole partitions to compare groups. However, some partitions at low levels
			span more than just the occipital lobe which led to problems when investigating differences only at the the level of
			this lobe (for exemple, looking only at the Occ. Lobe, 2 participants might have really similar networks. However, in one 
			participant, this network would span all of the frontal lobe too, leading to low score of similarity between them).
			Thus, the second version of the script avoids this issue by masking analysis with the mask of voxel of interest. 
			
			Moreover, if data comes from graph theory results, used LaunchMappPartitions to obtain the data for this step.


	1.2.1) use AverageDiCe/AverageDiCeWithinParticipants(in the newest version, if the latter cannot be found, its okay, they are the same, but with
		 different names) to get the average score for each participants
		
		Basically gives you the average intra vs inter group similarity. 
		Thus, instead of having a nVoxels x N x N matrix (where each participant is compared to each other participant), there will be
		a nVoxels x N (Where you get a single score per participant showing how he compare on average with the others). This is done
		both at the intra group level and the inter group level.

	1.2.2 use AverageDiCe AccrossScales

	1.3) Use CompareDiCe/CompareDiCePaired
		The paired version should be used on dependent data (repeated measures). 
		 

	1.4)Use mapP/Qvalues to obtain a map of the results
		




2) Visualizing differences between consensus maps for each group

	2.1) Use InStab2GroupStab
		This will take individual stability maps from a single group and compute its group stability map.
		
		Note: This uses a personally modified script from what Pierre uses, niak_brick_stability_group_maxime.

	2.2) Use a script to launch the mapping
		Note: no particular script was written for this, so take this: 'LaunchMapping_Rest_onlyCBSCMixed' as a example on how to write
		the script. 

3) Visualize differences in grouping
     Check out script, and take MakeAverageMaps.
